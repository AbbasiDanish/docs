**Welcome to the Pest Community!**

Pest's community is known for its friendliness, approachability, and respect for one another. The community's success is largely due to its members' contributions of not only code but also ideas, information, and support for each other's PHP testing endeavors. We're proud to promote the hashtag #GoodVibesOnly. Keep up to date, connect with other users, and introduce yourself in our community spaces.
