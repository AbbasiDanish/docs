# About

**Welcome to the Pest Testing Framework!** Pest is an elegant and sophisticated PHP testing framework that is designed to make the testing process enjoyable. Our goal is to make tests easy to read and understand, with a code syntax that closely resembles natural human language. Here is an example of a test written with our framework:

```php
function sum($a, $b) {
    return $a + $b;
}

test('sum', function () {
  expect(sum(1, 2))->toBe(3);
});
```

As you can see, you can expect a smooth and efficient coding experience thanks to its functional and declarative code style. Writing tests with Pest is simple, and the test reporting is well-organized, practical, and informative, with clear and concise error and stack trace displays for quick debugging.

**Interfaces that people love**

With Pest, you can obtain test reporting that is unmatched in its beauty, directly from the console! Furthermore, its easily readable error messages and stack traces enable you to debug with lightning-fast speed.
