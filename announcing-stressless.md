# Announcing Stressless

We are thrilled to announce the release of a brand new plugin for Pest PHP: Stressless. This plugin is designed to change the way we approach stress testing in PHP applications, ensuring that your applications are not just passing tests, but are also robust and reliable under regular or extreme conditions.

Before diving into Stressless, let's quickly revisit what stress testing is all about: Stress testing is a type of testing that evaluates the stability and reliability of your application under challenging conditions. This could mean handling a high volume of requests or managing large amounts of data. The goal is to ensure that your application not only works in ideal conditions but also maintains its integrity under pressure.

Stressless is born out of this necessity. It integrates seamlessly with Pest PHP, combining the power of stress testing with the simplicity and elegance of Pest's Expectation API.

Check out this YouTube video where we walk you through the installation and setup of the Stressless plugin:
