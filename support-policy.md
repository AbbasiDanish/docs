# Support Policy

As an open-source project, we do our best to address any reported bugs or issues on a best-effort basis. However, we cannot guarantee a specific resolution time or the availability of a fix for every issue.

For outdated versions, we will provide bug fixes for a period of two years from the release of the latest version. Once a new version of Pest is released, the previous version will be considered outdated.

| Major Version | PHP Compatibility | Initial Release | Bug Fixes Until
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pest v2 | >= PHP 8.1 | To be determined | To be determined
| Pest v1 | >= PHP 7.3 | January 7, 2021 | To be determined
