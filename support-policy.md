# Support Policy

We strive to resolve all reported bugs or issues to the best of our abilities as an open-source project. Nevertheless, we cannot ensure a fixed resolution time or guarantee the availability of a fix for every problem.

Bug fixes will be available for outdated versions for a duration of two years following the latest version's release. The previous version will be regarded as outdated once a new version of Pest is released.

| Major Version | PHP Compatibility | Initial Release | Bug Fixes Until
| ---------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pest v2 | >= PHP 8.1 | To be determined | To be determined
| Pest v1 | >= PHP 7.3 | January 7, 2021 | To be determined

Pest adheres to semantic versioning principles, where the version number `x.y.z` conveys the following information:
- When issuing bug fixes, the `z` number is incremented (e.g., 2.10.2 to 2.10.3).
- When adding new non-breaking features or improvements, the `y` number is incremented (e.g., 2.10.2 to 2.12.0).
- When introducing breaking changes, the `x` number is incremented (e.g., 2.10.2 to 3.0.0).
