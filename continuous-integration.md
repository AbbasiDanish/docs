# Continuous Integration

Up until now, we have only discussed running tests from the command line on your local machine. But, you can also run your tests from a CI platform of your choice. As `pestphp/pest` is included in your Composer development dependencies, you can easily execute the `/vendor/bin/pest` command within your CI platform's deployment pipeline.

## Example With GitHub Actions

If your application uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as its CI platform, the following guidelines will assist you in configuring Pest so that your application is automatically tested when someone pushes a commit to your GitHub repository.

To get started, create a `tests.yml` file within the `your-project/.github/workflows` directory. The file should have the following contents:

```yml
name: Tests

on: ['push', 'pull_request']

jobs:
  ci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup PHP
        uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
        with:
          php-version: 8.2
          tools: composer:v2
          coverage: xdebug

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader

      - name: Tests
        run: ./vendor/bin/pest
```

Naturally, you may customize the script above according to your requirements. For example, you may need to set up a database if your tests require one.

Once you have created your `tests.yml` file, commit and push the `tests.yml` file so GitHub Actions can run your tests. Keep in mind that once you make this commit, your test suite will execute on all new pull requests and commits.

Great job setting up Continuous Integration for your project to ensure codebase stability! Now, let's take a deeper dive into Pest's concepts by exploring it's test configuration capabilities: [Configuring Pest â†’](/docs/configuring-tests)
